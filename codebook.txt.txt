In this project, we are required to preform the following five steps. 

================================================

1. Download the dataset

The dataset was downloaded manually from the web. 

================================================

2. Assign each data to variables

From lines 01-08, the dataset is imported in the project. The names and the characteristics of the corresponding dataframes are described below.

	- features - features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
		The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
	- activities - activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
		List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels from 1 to 6)
	- subject_test - test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
		Contains the IDs of subjects (just integres from 1 to 30) in the test data
	- x_test - test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
		Contains recorded features test data
	- y_test - test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
		Contains the labels of activities in the test data
	- subject_train - test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
		Contains the IDs of subjects (just integres from 1 to 30) in the train data
	- x_train - test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
		Contains recorded features train data
	- y_train  - test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
		Contains the labels of activities in the train data

================================================

3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

In lines 10-13, we preform the following merging. 
	- x_binded (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test
	- y_binded (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test 
	- subject_binded (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test
	- data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X 

================================================

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

In line 18, we preformed the following. 
mean_std (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting data, in which we select columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

================================================

5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

We consider mean_std data frame. Labels of activities (in the number form) in code column of the are replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable.

================================================

6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

	- code column in mean_std renamed into activities
	- All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
	- All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
	- All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
	- All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
	- All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
	- All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

================================================

7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

The dataframe called summarized (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing mean_std taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export summarized into summarized.txt file.
